## 📖 About

**Love OS** is a personalized digital sanctuary for couples to share their love, memories, and daily moments. No login required - just two dedicated spaces for Cookie and Senorita to express their feelings, share moods, write love letters, and create beautiful memories together.

### ✨ The Concept

Instead of a traditional authentication system, Love OS features two dedicated spaces:
- 🍪 **Cookie's Space** - A command center with blue/primary theme for the boyfriend
- 💃 **Senorita's Space** - A sanctuary with pink/rose theme for the girlfriend

Both spaces are synced in real-time via Supabase, so when one person posts, the other gets instant notifications!

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and Yarn
- Supabase Account
- Access to the repository

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
cd /app
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps for Full Functionality

### ✅ Completed
- ✅ Frontend application fully configured and running
- ✅ Routing system working (direct URL access enabled)
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Supabase client integration ready
- ✅ All UI components functional

### 🔄 To Enable Full Features

To enable all features with database persistence and real-time synchronization, complete the following setup:

### 1. Database Schema Deployment ⚠️ Required

Execute the SQL schema in your Supabase project to create the required tables:

**Access:** [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/project/wurbydnkogvqhvtzttlp) → SQL Editor

**Tables to Create:**
```sql
-- letters: Store love letters between Cookie and Senorita
-- moods: Track emotional states with emojis and photos
-- photos: Couple photo gallery with captions
-- questions: Daily romantic questions
-- answers: User responses to questions
```

**Reference:** See `/app/SUPABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for complete SQL schema

**Why This is Important:**
Currently, the app UI is fully functional but API calls to Supabase return 406 errors because the database tables don't exist yet. Once you run the SQL schema, all features (letters, moods, photos, questions) will work with real-time updates!

### 2. Storage Configuration

Set up cloud storage for media files:

1. Navigate to **Storage** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Create bucket: `mood-photos` (Public access)
3. Configure policies:
   - **Upload**: Authenticated users can upload
   - **Read**: Public read access for all photos
   - **Delete**: Users can delete their own files

### 3. Real-time Enablement

Enable real-time subscriptions for instant updates:

1. Go to **Database** → **Replication** in Supabase
2. Toggle **Realtime** ON for:
   - `letters` table
   - `moods` table
   - `photos` table
   - `answers` table

### 4. Data Seeding (Optional)

Populate initial data for better user experience:

```sql
-- Insert sample romantic questions
INSERT INTO questions (question_text, category, date) VALUES
  ('What made you fall in love with me?', 'deep', '2025-01-08'),
  ('What is your favorite memory of us?', 'memories', '2025-01-09'),
  ('Where do you see us in 5 years?', 'future', '2025-01-10');
```

### 5. Verification Testing

Once database is set up, test the following workflows:

**Letters Module:**
- [ ] Write and send a letter
- [ ] View letter in recipient's dashboard
- [ ] Verify real-time notification

**Mood Sharing:**
- [ ] Select mood with emoji
- [ ] Add note and photo
- [ ] Confirm partner receives update

**Photo Gallery:**
- [ ] Upload couple photo with caption
- [ ] View in gallery grid
- [ ] Full-screen photo viewer

**Daily Questions:**
- [ ] Answer today's question
- [ ] View partner's answer
- [ ] Navigate to random questions

**Settings:**
- [ ] Change color theme
- [ ] Toggle dark/light mode
- [ ] Verify persistence across sessions

### 6. Production Considerations

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Review and update Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- [ ] Configure appropriate storage size limits
- [ ] Set up database backups in Supabase
- [ ] Test real-time connection stability
- [ ] Verify error handling for offline scenarios
- [ ] Review CORS settings if deploying to custom domain

**Estimated Setup Time:** 15-30 minutes

## 📝 Recent Updates

### January 7, 2025 - Routing Fix 🎉

**Major Fix: Direct URL Access**
1. **SpaceContext Enhancement** - Added URL-based initialization
   - Context now reads pathname on initial load
   - Falls back to URL if localStorage is empty
   - Syncs space state with URL changes in real-time
   - Smart initialization: localStorage → URL → null

2. **Dashboard Components** - Updated redirect logic
   - Removed aggressive redirect that blocked direct URL access
   - Added beautiful loading states during initialization
   - Now only redirects if explicitly on wrong space
   - Prevents flash of wrong content

3. **Environment Setup** - Created `/app/frontend/.env`
   - Added Supabase URL and anon key
   - Vite automatically picks up environment variables
   - Ready for real-time database connections

**What This Enables:**
- 🔗 **Shareable URLs**: Send direct links to `/cookie` or `/senorita`
- 📑 **Bookmarkable**: Save favorite space in browser bookmarks
- 💾 **Persistent**: Space preference saved across sessions
- 🔄 **Smooth Navigation**: No unexpected redirects
- ⚡ **Fast Loading**: Minimal loading states

**Technical Details:**
- See `/app/ROUTING_FIX_SUMMARY.md` for complete technical documentation
- Files modified: `SpaceContext.tsx`, `CookieDashboard.tsx`, `SenoritaDashboard.tsx`

### January 2025 - Major Bug Fixes & Improvements

**Fixed Issues:**
1. **MoodEnhanced.tsx Syntax Error** - Fixed typo `selected Mood` → `selectedMood` on line 164
2. **Deprecated AuthContext Removal** - Removed all references to the old authentication system
3. **Component Updates:**
   - Updated `NicknameCycle.tsx` to use SpaceContext instead of AuthContext
   - Updated `MoodSharing.tsx` to use SpaceContext with correct user_name field
   - All components now properly use Cookie/Senorita names
4. **Environment Configuration** - Added `.env` file with Supabase credentials
5. **Database Schema Alignment** - Updated components to match simplified schema (user_name instead of user_id)

**Technical Improvements:**
- Hot reload working perfectly
- No compilation errors
- All routes accessible and functional
- Real-time subscriptions configured
- Theme system fully operational
